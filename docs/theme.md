# Theme

The theme of a board game should be one of the last considerations in its design. It is helpful, however, to describe game concepts and rules in terms of certain aspects of a theme.

Note that the theme detailed below is tentative and subject to change given publication requirements.
Similarly, the name CITIZEN is subject to change as needed.

## Background

Food is scarce in the outer colonies. Sickness and poverty run rampant.  
The edge of the Empire lies only a parsec away, and with it the benefits of structured society.  
But you are not a citizen.

You and your "comrades" have taken up the occupation of trading among the outer colonies.  
If you were to gather up enough resources from your buisiness pursuits, citizenship might be bought.

Unfortunately, the Empire does not take kindly to trader scum. Only one authorized citizenship is for sale ...

## Gameplay

During this game, your goal is to position yourself optimally within the trading buisiness. When the time comes, you aim to outbid your comrades and obtain Empire citizenship.

Buying raw materials from the colonies takes place in four phases, after which the final bid for citizenship occurs. In other words, each trader will have the opportunity to buy four shipments of raw material from the colonies.

Entering the market for certain combinations of raw materials is not without benefit. Over 70 unique skills that will help you (or hinder your competition) during bidding wars will become available as your build your target market.
